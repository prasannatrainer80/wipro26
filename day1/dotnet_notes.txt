.NET framework contains more than 270+ language characteristics have been formed as a single group, where we can use one language features within another language. 

.NET framework lets developers write applications in multiple languages like C#, VB etc  that can run on any env without changing source code, 
ensures efficiently and platform independent applications we can make.

The main objective of .NET framework is reusable code and consistent behaviour across various applications.

Characterstics of .NET

   -> Supports large no.of programming languages

   -> Provides a huge class libraries for common operations

   -> Handles memory management automatically through GC

   -> Ensures security through code access Security

   -> We can create any kind of applications as Console/Windows/Web/Service Oriented and Mobile Apps
